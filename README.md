Hi, I’m an undergraduate pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and a particular interest in building useful and practical systems.

I have experience in building end-to-end AI/ML projects, ranging from machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack AI systems. My experience includes a solid background in Data Structures, OOP, DBMS, and Operating Systems.

I have experience in projects such as handwritten digit recognition, plant disease classification, and other AI-based projects to solve real-world problems. I’m very interested in scaling ML models, optimizing inference, and integrating AI systems in production-ready environments.

I’m interested in working on AI/ML projects, research projects, and open-source projects, and I’m always working on improving my skills in deep learning, backend development, cloud infrastructure, and system design.

⚡ I enjoy building AI research concepts into fully functional systems.
